The AI and Deep Learning Specialization is a foundational program that will aid in your comprehension of deep learnings potential, difficulties, and effects as well as equip you to take part in the creation of cutting-edge AI technology.We will start this course by understanding the fundamentals and use cases for AI and move on to building next-gen intelligent apps using OpenAIâ€™s powerful models and Next.js 13.Well conclude the course by learning about basic programming concepts using Python, such as lists, dictionaries, classes, functions, and loops, and practice writing clean and readable code with exercises for each topic. Well also learn how to make your programs interactive and how to test your code safely before adding it to a project. It is a fast-paced, thorough introduction to programming with Python 3.10+ that will have you writing programs, solving problems, and making things that work in no time. In this quarter we will also learn Git, the distributed version control system. We will also review Git-based GitHub services.'},
      { id:6 ,title:'Networking', image: "https://res.cloudinary.com/di1kessdw/image/upload/v1734594784/gov_sindh/advancedcourse/a1_oqnmbs.jpg" , desc:'Cloud-native architecture and technologies are an approach to designing, constructing, and operating workloads that are built in the cloud and take full advantage of the cloud computing model. Cloud-native technologies empower organizations to build and run scalable applications in modern, dynamic environments such as public, private, and hybrid clouds. Containers, service meshes, microservices, immutable infrastructure, and declarative APIs exemplify this approach.These techniques enable loosely coupled systems that are resilient, manageable, and observable. Combined with robust automation, they allow engineers to make high-impact changes frequently and predictably with minimal toil.Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. In this course, you will learn how to develop cloud applications using cloud-native technologies like Containers, Kubernetes, and CDK for Kubernetes.'},
